# Couple Notes

Built using [choo](https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo) and markdown files. The posts are inlined into your app for a pseudo-*static* blog! Supports pagination & permalinks.

Some [npm scripts](https://docs.npmjs.com/misc/scripts) are included for creating new posts, building for production, and deploying to github pages from the [dist directory](https://gist.github.com/cobyism/4730490). Take a peek in **package.json**.
